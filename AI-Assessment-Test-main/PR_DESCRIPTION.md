# Fix: Display candidate test results even without assignment records

## Problem
Candidates who completed tests were not appearing in the HR dashboard performance reports if they didn't have formal assignment records. This was causing test results to be "lost" from the reporting system.

## Solution
Modified the backend logic to include candidates who have test attempts but no assignment records, ensuring all test takers appear in the performance reports.

## Changes Made

### Backend Changes
- **`server/controllers/hr-controller.js`**: Updated `getTestResults` function to include candidates with attempts but no assignments
- **`server/models/test-assignment-model.js`**: Enhanced model structure
- **`server/router/hr-router.js`**: Updated routing

### Frontend Changes
- **`client/src/components/reports/CandidatePerformanceTable.jsx`**: Updated to display new candidate data
- **`client/src/components/reports/TestAnalytics.jsx`**: Enhanced analytics display
- **`client/src/pages/hr/Reports.jsx`**: Improved reports page
- **`client/src/pages/hr/TestResults.jsx`**: Enhanced test results page
- **`client/src/services/api.js`**: Updated API calls

### Project Maintenance
- **`.gitignore`**: Added comprehensive gitignore file to exclude unnecessary files

## Testing
- ✅ Verified that candidates with test attempts now appear in HR dashboard
- ✅ Confirmed existing functionality remains intact
- ✅ Tested with both assigned and unassigned test scenarios

## Impact
This fix ensures that all candidates who have taken tests will now appear in the HR dashboard, regardless of whether they were formally assigned through the system or accessed the test directly.
